# Design Documents for raising children

There are many books out there for raising children, but none in the form of
design documents. This is not a replacement for other forms of advice, but
can hopefully help cut through some of the inherent complexity involved in
the process.

I am a husband and father of two: a two year old daughter and a 2 month old
son. I am also the developer of the design documentation tool [artifact][1],
which these design documents are written in. I mostly did this for fun, and
I hope you can have fun in reading them.
